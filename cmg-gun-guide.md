# ðŸ”« CMG Gun Guide

There are two types of custom guns that are available for purchase on the [CMG store](https://store.cmgstudios.net/)&#x20;

## Custom Guns (Import)

This is where you are able to import your own custom unique weapon into the server. Upon purchase you will need to then open a support ticket in the CMG Support Discord. You will have to provide a model for the custom gun yourself.



Popular methods of obtaining models are through third party providers such as [GTA5-Mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/) or through members of the CMG community who make models.

## Customs Guns (Whitelist)

This is where you are able to purchase access to a pre-existing weapon that has been imported into the server by a player. To gain access to someone's weapon you will need to first make contact with someone who has a whitelisted weapon and ask them if you are able to purchase access to their weapon. They will most likely give you a price in order to get an access code.

Once you have gained an access code for a whitelisted weapon you will be able to then purchase a custom weapon whitelist off the [CMG store](https://store.cmgstudios.net/).&#x20;

![You will be prompted with your perm ID which you can get through /getmyid in game](<.gitbook/assets/image (103).png>)

Once you have added the Custom Guns (Whitelist) to your basket you will be able to place the code in the prompt box and click continue in order to confirm your purchase.

Once you have purchased the Customs Guns (Whitelist) and the code is confirmed you will then need to re-log (Re-launch the game) in order to then see this as an available weapon in the store.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are to import a custom weapon that is a re-skin of an existing CMG weapon for example a mosin. Expect that it will peform the exact same as the normal version.

## Gun Damage, Reload Speeds etc

When you import a Gun, each gun is assigned damage values, reload values etc, Developers changes these based on what category the gun is from (Assault Rifle, SMG, Pistol, Sniper & Melee), people who make guns don't typically provide these files since they'll be changed by the Developers, if you feel like the Damage values for your gun isn't right you can try speak to a Developer via the Ticket Discord to get it checked.\


Exceptions to normal weapon performance would be the following

* **Light Machine Gun** (LMG) This is purchasable through a Sniper slot and the performance in terms of damage would copy an Assault Rifle but it would pertain a higher magazine size.&#x20;
* **Marksman Rifles** This is purchasable through a Sniper slot and the performance would be the same as an imported Sniper meaning that it would be bolt action and would not be a Semi-Automatic weapon.
