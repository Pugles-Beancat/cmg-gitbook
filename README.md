# üìù CMG

## Server Rules :scroll:

The server rules can either be found by pressing your _**F1**_ hotkey on your keyboard while in game or on the forums [here](https://cmgstudios.net/forums/index.php?/fivem-rules/).

If you feel stuck or unsure at any point I would recommend that you either go to the #game-support channel in the CMG discord or you make a ticket in game via the _**/calladmin**_ command and explain to the member of staff that you are unsure and would like some help.

## Server Restarts :hammer\_pick:

The server will restart every morning at 10am the expected downtime of the server post restarting is 5 minutes to around an hour depending on any work or maintenance that might be ongoing at the time.

If you feel like the server is down when it is not meant to be your first port of call would be to check the #status channel in the CMG Discord, If there is an ongoing issue with FiveM a notice will be automatically be posted here.

## Boot Wipe :tada:

This happens at the first day of every month.

Why does this happen? Inventory wipes happen monthly to ensure the server's economy remains stable, and to prevent people gathering a massive arsenal turning the city into a warzone.

What exactly gets wiped:

* All items in your Inventory (L)&#x20;
* All items in your vehicle boots.&#x20;
* All items in your houses chests.&#x20;
* Weapons equipped.&#x20;
* Everything else remains.

## Experiencing Texture loss? :smile:

There is a quick and easy solution in your settings if you press the hotkey **ESC** then navigate to graphics and turn up **Extended Texture Budget** this should be a quick solution to texture loss when playing CMG. See an image below!

## Basic commands :toolbox:

There are lots of commands that can be used in order to enhance your gameplay here's a list and explanation of some

* **/getmyid**  This command will fetch your permanent ID which you might have to use in order to apply for roleplay factions or any purchases on the store that you might make.
* **/unstuck**  This command will teleport you to ground level if you find yourself stuck under the map and are unable to get out. Upon running the command you will have a prompt telling you to stay still for 30 seconds and then you will be teleported to the surface.
* **F1** This hotkey will bring up the CMG rules and can be useful as a new player to understand peoples actions as your going around the city. See an image below.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (60).png>)

* **F10** This hotkey brings up your warning menu, this is where if you have been punished for breaking a server rule you will be able to see the following information (The rulebreak, the punishment length, the amount of points it has put on your F10 and who has given the punishment to you). See an image below.

![This would be considered as a clean F10](<.gitbook/assets/image (122).png>)

* **F2** This hotkey brings up your CMG settings menu which is different from your normal GTA settings and includes various things to toggle such as render distances, street names etc which is something which we encourage you to play with, see an image below.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (101).png>)

* **/crosshair** CMG supports the use of custom crosshairs and you do not have to run any external software to do so. With this menu you can customise and create a crosshair to suit your needs. See an image below.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (81).png>)

* **/storeallweapons & /storecurrentweapon** These commands can be used to store weapons or items that you have on your person and are then accessible through your inventory at any time.
* **L** This hotkey brings up your inventory menu, where you can equip using **Use**, **Trash** which will discard the weapon or item forever, **Give to nearest player** which will prompt you for a Temp ID and amount to give (Temp ID is the numbers above someone's head) or to **Move** the item which in most cases would be in the boot of a car to secure your weapons / items. See an image below.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (111).png>)

* **/calladmin** This command will bring up a prompt menu on the left of your screen asking you to describe your issue. This is where you tell the Staff team the issue your facing and they will respond at the earliest convenience. See an image below.

:warning:WARNING :warning:

When you have items on your person or in your inventory and you **Die** the items will be placed in a loot bag on your body which any player can loot, so it is advised you store weapons / items in the boot of your vehicle.

* Discord command: **/checkhours** This is to be used in the CMG Discord and can be used to check how many hours **YOU** have in playtime. This can be useful for when your applying for factions or are just curious. See an image below.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (67).png>)

* **Bag Searching** When a player dies if they have any sort of weapon/item on their person then they will drop a loot bag, to loot this you need to walk up to the bag point your crosshair at the bag until you see a circle interaction icon and click **E** this will open up a menu similar to your inventory [above](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F9OKdgP0BI4PujRLZgRNL%2Fuploads%2FaRBYJ1IgwHWwGUoSz5J7%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=98618a71-1fe1-4d19-9417-e0736c51bbdf) where you can then move the items in your own inventory for use.

## Want to report a player? :warning:

If you would like to report a player that you suspect has broke a rule against you then you can do so by using the **/calladmin** command in game and giving a brief explanation to the situation. Once a member of the CMG Staff team is free they will accept your ticket and speak to you.

:warning: WARNING :warning:

In order to report someone for a rulebreak you need to be able to provide a POV (Point of view) in the form of a video/clip in order to prove what you are reporting.

RDM - If you have been RDM'd then you need to provide a 10 minute clip of the situation this is so the Staff member can check for any previous initiation that the culprit could have had on you.

NRTI - If you have been initiated on for no reason then you will need to provide a 5 minute clip so the Staff member can check if the person could have had any reason to initiate in the last 5 minutes prior.

VDM, Toxicity, Trolling, Power/Meta gaming - No specific amount of time needed but understand if a Staff member asks you for more context to a situation or a longer clip in some instances.



If no staff member has taken your report and you wish to it being seen to you can make a player report on the forums [here](https://cmgstudios.net/forums/index.php?/forms/10-player-report/). Where you can guarantee it being picked up by a member of the staff team.
