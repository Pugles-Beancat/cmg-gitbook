# ðŸ“± CMG Phone Guide

## The Phone :mobile\_phone:

On CMG by default everyone has a mobile phone provided to them when they are on the server, you are assigned a number that is unique to you and people can use to call you. The hotkey for this is **K**.

From here you can see there are a good amount of applications on your CMG phone that come of use which are listed below:

* **Phone** This is used to call other people, you can either call a number directly or by adding a persons phone number to your contacts.
* **Camera** This can be used to take pictures in the city.
* **Messages** This is used to message people who are in your contacts lists.
* **Notes** This is used to make any notes that you might want to make on your phone.
* **Settings** This is used to change different settings on your phone such as wallpapers, ringtones, do not disturb etc.
* **Valet** This is a perk of CMG Platinum which is purchasable from the CMG store [here](https://store.cmgstudios.net/category/subscriptions).
* **Monzo** This is used as a personal bank where you can send money to other players via a wire transfer.
* **Twitter** This is used to make posts, you can use this place to sell in-game items or just to chat with other players.

## Adding a Contact :scroll:

To add a contact to your phone on CMG you must first obtain someone's phone number which can be found by asking for someone's ID card.

If you walk up to a player and press **E** a radial menu should appear like the image below.

Once you press **E** their ID will show along with their phone number.

From here you can take their phone number and go on the contacts app on your CMG phone where you can then add a contact using the phone number on the persons ID. You can also find your own phone number in the **Settings** app.

* **Perm ID** To get a players Perm ID you would use the **/getid** command with the following usage. If you are next to a player they will have numbers above their head which is called their **Temp ID** in order to get their Perm ID you will need to use /getid tempid (tempid being the users **Temp ID** above their head)
