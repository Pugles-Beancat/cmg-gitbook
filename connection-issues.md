# ðŸ’» Connection Issues

If there is ever a server outage that is related to CMG's infrastructure or through FiveM's infrastructure then there will be a message in the #status channel at the top of the discord. There are no expected wait times for incidents to be resolved when it is FiveM's infrastructure. So before trying to troubleshoot your issue check #status for any ongoing problems.

You can also see a more in-depth status through the status sites below.

**FiveM** - [Here](https://status.cfx.re/)

**CMG Studios** - [Here](https://status.cmgstudios.net/)

Before ruling out that any issues that you are facing are to do with CMG specifically it would be beneficial to read the official Cfx.re client issues FAQ found [here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/support/client-issues/) in order to complete basic troubleshooting of your issue.

## Common Errors :warning:

There are quite a few common errors when connecting to the server you might face commonly and there will be resolutions attached to each explained error.

This commonly happens if you have been timed out from the server due to your current network conditions and the solution is to wait out the 120 seconds and then connect again once you have waited.

This is a common error that doesn't have a permanent solution, however you can do the following.

{% hint style="success" %}
Press **F8** on your keyboard to open the Console and then type **Connect s1.cmg.city**
{% endhint %}

## Client-sided Issues

These are issues that are with your host machine that prevent you from joining the server and their resolutions.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (41).png>)

This is a common error where either your FiveM cache is full and it is causing assets fail to download which prevent you from connecting or where you have no or little free memory left on the drive you have FiveM installed on.

{% hint style="success" %}
To solve this you can clear your Cache by following these steps below :sunglasses:\
\
<mark style="color:green;">**1**</mark> - Right click **FiveM** on your desktop and click **Open file Location**\
****\
****<mark style="color:green;">**2**</mark> - You should then be brought to the start menu folder where you then need to repeat the same step to **Open file location**\
****\
****<mark style="color:green;">**3**</mark> - You should then be presented with a couple folders which you should then click **FiveM application data**\
****\
****<mark style="color:green;">**4**</mark>** ** - Once you are in that folder if you open the folder **Data**\
****\
****<mark style="color:green;">**5**</mark> - Once you are in that folder if you open the folder **Cache**\
****\
****<mark style="color:green;">**6**</mark> - Once you are in that folder if you open the folder **Server-cache-priv**\
