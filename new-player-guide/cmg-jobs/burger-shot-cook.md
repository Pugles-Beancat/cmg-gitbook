Upon clocking on as a taco seller you will get a prompt telling you that a waypoint has been set for the burgershot store where you can start your new career! See an image below.

A waypoint should be placed on your GPS for the burgershot where you can then start your shift as a Burger Shot cook. See an image below.

Once you arrive you will be in the main lobby of the burger shot resturaunt from there you will need to enter the kitchen area where you can start your work.

Walk up to one of the blue arrows and press **E** in order to start cooking!

Once you have started cooking there should be a table behind you which should guide you through the process of making a burger. See an image below.

Once you have collected all ingredients you will need to cook the burger in the cooker, you will then see a semi circle puzzle where you have to press **SPACE** when the white bar matches up with the green section. See an image below.

You will have to repeat this puzzle three times and once you are finished you will have a cooked burger on a tray which you need to take to the cash register in order to be paid for your work!

You will recieve your pay as well as a burger!
