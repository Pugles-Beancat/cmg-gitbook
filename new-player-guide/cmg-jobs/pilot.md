Once you arrive at the airport hanger there will be a green in colour plane blip on the ground telling you to press **E** to bring up the pilot menu which will show a list of planes that you can use to work in. As you do the pilot job more and more you can unlock higher capacity planes which will grant you a higher paycheck.
