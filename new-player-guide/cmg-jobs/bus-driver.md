Upon clocking on as a bus driver you will get a prompt telling you that a waypoint has been set for you to go to in order to start your shift. See an image below.

If you open your GPS using the hotkey **ESC** you will see a waypoint on your GPS to where you need to go to start your shift. See an image below.

Once you reach the waypoint you can then pull out a bus by pressing **E** on the red marker on the floor. You should be then in a bus with a secondary waypoint placed indicating your bus route.

You then need to follow the route until you have been to all 15 destinations on your bus route.

Once you have finished your 15 destinations you should find yourself back at the starting point, you should recieve your money and get a notification at the bottom left of your screen indicating your shift is complete.
