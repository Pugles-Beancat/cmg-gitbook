Upon clocking on as a taco seller you will get a prompt telling you that you can purchase the truck from the Simeons dealership and start selling tacos! See an image below.

The taco truck in simeons costs **Â£250,000** so you will need this cash to permanently purchase the truck before being able to start the job
