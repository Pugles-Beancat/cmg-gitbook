# Royal Mail Driver

## Clocking on :timer:

To start any job you need to clock on as it before hand at **City Hall.** See an image below.

Once you have clocked on there will be a prompt telling you a waypoint has been set for you to go to in order to start your shift as a **Royal Mail Driver**.

If you open your GPS using the hotkey **ESC** you will see a waypoint on your GPS to where you need to go to start your shift. See an image below.

Once you have arrived at the waypoint there will be a red truck on the floor and when you stand over it there should be a prompt that states **Press E to start your Royal Mail job.** See an image below.

Upon pressing **E** you will spawn your Royal Mail van. You will also get a waypoint to your first delivery as well as a tracker on the right which shows your earnings and how many packages you have delivered. See an image below.

You now need to head to your first waypoint.

Upon arrival to your waypoint you will receive cash for your delivery and a package is added to the counter as well as receiving a new waypoint. See an image below.

Once you have delivered all 15 packages your last delivery should take you back to the shift starting point and your shift should complete with your earnings given to you. There should also be a confirmation on the left of your screen to say the shift has been completed. See an image below.
